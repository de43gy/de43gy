# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm @de43gy

## About Me

I am a freelance DevOps engineer passionate about bridging technology and art. I am drawn to challenging and creative projects where I can apply my skills in DevOps, development, and DIY electronics to create interactive installations, unique game mechanics, and efficient automated systems

ðŸ‘€ My interests include:
- Science/media and sound art;
- DIY electronics;
- Game development and exploring new approaches in gamedev;
- Art installations at festivals and exposition;
- Exploring the development of conversational AI, including chatbots, and investigating autonomous AI agents.

ðŸŒ± I am currently learning GDScript and Godot Engine, as well as Python and JavaScript.

I am from Russia and I am against the war in Ukraine. I am ready to offer my technical skills (DevOps, web application and chatbot development, infrastructure support) on a voluntary basis to non-profit and human rights organizations that share my values.
